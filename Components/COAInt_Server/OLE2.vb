' This class temporarily replaces clsOLE whilst we decide on what to do with this functionality. Only the properties that are called externally have had code stumps
' created. Original code is held in clsOLE which is not inclued in the project file as it errors and needs rework to handle encryption and different file access methods.
' Possibly suggest rewriting the class rather than upgrading.
